#Project Proposal:
1. Overview:
This project is to make some of web pages that users can achieve to see he schedule and join in the upcoming local events. Users can register an account first. And then they can check all the upcoming local events in one month. Events include sport games, great movies leasing, local festivals, great discount information. Any events that users are interested in can be chosen to join in. We have a join in button for every event. After users join in the event, the detail message and direction will be sent to users. In addition, users will be reminded when the event that they have joined in is coming.
2. Scope
The main goal of this project is to develop a data-based website that provides information to users. It will be designed as an event poster that loads relative comprehensive events/activities on the web page. The team members will be using ASP.NET Code-First Technology to build the database and connect to HTML pages, applying ASP.NET MVC/API as the basic framework, and using CSS, AngularJS and JavaScript to decorate the web pages.
3. What has this project been done:
This project has done a fully structured layout in HTML and functional Markups in CSS. It includes either static picture or dynamic video to display events. A pop-up <div> will show up after clicking each signle events. This project also developed a search bar that shows specific events when typing specific words. The search bar used AngularJS as the basic support at back-end. In addition, an individual user-authentication has also been developed in ASP.NET MVC. It can be logged in either register on the web page or connecting google or facebook account.
